  cve: CVE-2024-0455
  summary: ""
  details: |-
    The inclusion of the web scraper for AnythingLLM means that any user with the proper authorization level (manager, admin, and when in single user) could put in the URL
    ```
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance
    ```
    which is a special IP and URL that resolves only when the request comes from within an EC2 instance. This would allow the user to see the connection/secret credentials for their specific instance and be able to manage it regardless of who deployed it.

    The user would have to have pre-existing knowledge of the hosting infra which the target instance is deployed on, but if sent - would resolve if on EC2 and the proper `iptable` or firewall rule is not configured for their setup.
