  cve: CVE-2024-1483
  summary: mlflow Path Traversal vulnerability
  details: A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2, allowing
    attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series of HTTP
    POST requests with specially crafted 'artifact_location' and 'source' parameters,
    using a local URI with '#' instead of '?', an attacker can traverse the server's
    directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
    input in the server's handlers.
