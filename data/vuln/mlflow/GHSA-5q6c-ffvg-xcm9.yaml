  name: mlflow
  cve: CVE-2024-0520
  summary: Remote code execution in mlflow
  details: A vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow version 8.2.1 allows for remote code execution
    due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('Command
    Injection') within the `mlflow.data.http_dataset_source.py` module. Specifically,
    when loading a dataset from a source URL with an HTTP scheme, the filename extracted
    from the `Content-Disposition` header or the URL path is used to generate the
    final file path without proper sanitization. This flaw enables an attacker to
    control the file path fully by utilizing path traversal or absolute path techniques,
    such as '../../tmp/poc.txt' or '/tmp/poc.txt', leading to arbitrary file write.
    Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to execute commands
    on the vulnerable machine, potentially gaining access to data and model information.
    The issue is fixed in version 2.9.0.
