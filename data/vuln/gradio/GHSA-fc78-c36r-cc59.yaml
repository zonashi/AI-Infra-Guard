  name: gradio
  cve: CVE-2024-4254
  summary: ""
  details: The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository,
    specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to
    improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit
    checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running
    of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository
    and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets
    such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN,
    AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in
    the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.
