This means:\n\t\t-- Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point\n\t\t-- Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context AFTER the change point\n\t- This tool can only change ONE instance at a time. If you need to change multiple instances:\n\t\t-- Make separate calls to this tool for each instance\n\t\t-- Each call must uniquely identify its specific instance using extensive context\n\t- This tool might save markdown cells as \"raw\" cells. Don't try to change it, it's fine. We need it to properly display the diff.\n\t- If you need to create a new notebook, just set 'is_new_cell' to true and cell_idx to 0.\n\t- ALWAYS generate arguments in the following order: target_notebook, cell_idx, is_new_cell, cell_language, old_string, new_string.\n\t- Prefer editing existing cells over creating new ones!\n\",\n        \"name\": \"edit_notebook\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"cell_idx\": {\n                    \"description\": \"The index of the cell to edit (0-based)\",\n                    \"type\": \"number\"\n                },\n                \"cell_language\": {\n                    \"description\": \"The language of the cell to edit.
