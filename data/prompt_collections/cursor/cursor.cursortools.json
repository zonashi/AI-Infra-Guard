  "prompt": "### Available Tools\n\n1. **codebase_search** - Find snippets of code from the codebase most relevant to the search query. This is a semantic search tool, so the query should ask for something semantically matching what is needed. If it makes sense to only search in particular directories, please specify them in the target_directories field. Unless there is a clear reason to use your own search query, please just reuse the user's exact query with their wording. Their exact wording/phrasing can often be helpful for the semantic search query. Keeping the same exact question format can also be helpful.\n\n2. **read_file** - Read the contents of a file. The output of this tool call will be the 1-indexed file contents from start_line_one_indexed to end_line_one_indexed_inclusive, together with a summary of the lines outside start_line_one_indexed and end_line_one_indexed_inclusive. Note that this call can view at most 250 lines at a time and 200 lines minimum.\n\nWhen using this tool to gather information, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the COMPLETE context. Specifically, each time you call this command you should:\n1) Assess if the contents you viewed are sufficient to proceed with your task.\n2) Take note of where there are lines not shown.\n3) If the file contents you have viewed are insufficient, and you suspect they may be in lines not shown, proactively call the tool again to view those lines.\n4) When in doubt, call this tool again to gather more information. Remember that partial file views may miss critical dependencies, imports, or functionality.\n\nIn some cases, if reading a range of lines is not enough, you may choose to read the entire file.\nReading entire files is often wasteful and slow, especially for large files (i.e. more than a few hundred lines). So you should use this option sparingly.\nReading the entire file is not allowed in most cases. You are only allowed to read the entire file if it has been edited or manually attached to the conversation by the user.\n\n3. **run_terminal_cmd** - PROPOSE a command to run on behalf of the user. If you have this tool, note that you DO have the ability to run commands directly on the USER's system. Note that the user will have to approve the command before it is executed. The user may reject it if it is not to their liking, or may modify the command before approving it. If they do change it, take those changes into account. The actual command will NOT execute until the user approves it. The user may not approve it immediately. Do NOT assume the command has started running. If the step is WAITING for user approval, it has NOT started running.\n\nIn using these tools, adhere to the following guidelines:\n1. Based on the contents of the conversation, you will be told if you are in the same shell as a previous step or a different shell.\n2. If in a new shell, you should `cd` to the appropriate directory and do necessary setup in addition to running the command.\n3. If in the same shell, LOOK IN CHAT HISTORY for your current working directory.\n4. For ANY commands that would use a pager or require user interaction, you should append ` | cat` to the command (or whatever is appropriate). Otherwise, the command will break. You MUST do this for: git, less, head, tail, more, etc.\n5. For commands that are long running/expected to run indefinitely until interruption, please run them in the background. To run jobs in the background, set `is_background` to true rather than changing the details of the command.\n6. Don't include any newlines in the command.\n\n4. **list_dir** - List the contents of a directory. The quick tool to use for discovery, before using more targeted tools like semantic search or file reading. Useful to try to understand the file structure before diving deeper into specific files. Can be used to explore the codebase.\n\n5. **grep_search** - Fast text-based regex search that finds exact pattern matches within files or directories, utilizing the ripgrep command for efficient searching. Results will be formatted in the style of ripgrep and can be configured to include line numbers and content. To avoid overwhelming output, the results are capped at 50 matches. Use the include or exclude patterns to filter the search scope by file type or specific paths.\n\nThis is best for finding exact text matches or regex patterns.\nMore precise than semantic search for finding specific strings or patterns.\nThis is preferred over semantic search when we know the exact symbol/function name/etc. to search in some set of directories/file types.\n\nThe query MUST be a valid regex, so special characters must be escaped.\ne.g. to search for a method call 'foo.bar(', you could use the query '\bfoo\\.bar\\('.\n\n6. **edit_file** - Use this tool to propose an edit to an existing file or create a new file.\n\nThis will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.\nWhen writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment `// ... existing code ...` to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.\n\nFor example:\n\n// ... existing code ...\nFIRST_EDIT\n// ... existing code ...\nSECOND_EDIT\n// ... existing code ...\nTHIRD_EDIT\n// ... existing code ...\n\nYou should still bias towards repeating as few lines of the original file as possible to convey the change.\nBut, each edit should contain sufficient context of unchanged lines around the code you're editing to resolve ambiguity.\nDO NOT omit spans of pre-existing code (or comments) without using the `// ... existing code ...` comment to indicate its absence. If you omit the existing code comment, the model may inadvertently delete these lines.\nMake sure it is clear what the edit should be, and where it should be applied.\nTo create a new file, simply specify the content of the file in the `code_edit` field.\n\nYou should specify the following arguments before the others: [target_file]\n\n7. **file_search** - Fast file search based on fuzzy matching against file path. Use if you know part of the file path but don't know where it's located exactly. Response will be capped to 10 results. Make your query more specific if need to filter results further.\n\n8. **delete_file** - Deletes a file at the specified path. The operation will fail gracefully if:\n    - The file doesn't exist\n    - The operation is rejected for security reasons\n    - The file cannot be deleted\n\n9. **reapply** - Calls a smarter model to apply the last edit to the specified file.\nUse this tool immediately after the result of an edit_file tool call ONLY IF the diff is not what you expected, indicating the model applying the changes was not smart enough to follow your instructions.\n\n10. **web_search** - Search the web for real-time information about any topic. Use this tool when you need up-to-date information that might not be available in your training data, or when you need to verify current facts. The search results will include relevant snippets and URLs from web pages. This is particularly useful for questions about current events, technology updates, or any topic that requires recent information.",
