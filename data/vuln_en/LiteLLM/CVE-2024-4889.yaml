  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-4889
  summary: Code injection vulnerability in LiteLLM's secret management system.
  details: |
    A code injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm application, version 1.34.6, due to the use of unvalidated input in the `eval` function within the secret management system. This vulnerability requires a valid Google KMS configuration file to be exploitable. Specifically, by setting the `UI_LOGO_PATH` variable to a remote server address in the `get_image` function, an attacker can write a malicious Google KMS configuration file to the `cached_logo.jpg` file. This file can then be used to execute arbitrary code by assigning malicious code to the `SAVE_CONFIG_TO_DB` environment variable, leading to full system control. The vulnerability is contingent upon the use of the Google KMS feature.

  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to a version patched against CVE-2024-4889.
    2. Avoid using unvalidated input in `eval` functions.
    3. Implement strict input validation for all user-controlled variables, especially those affecting file paths or configuration.
    4. Restrict the ability to set `UI_LOGO_PATH` to remote server addresses.
    5. Ensure that the Google KMS feature is configured securely and that its configuration files cannot be tampered with.
