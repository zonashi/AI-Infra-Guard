  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-8984
  summary: LiteLLM is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via crafted HTTP requests.
  details: |
    A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in berriai/litellm version v1.44.5.
    This vulnerability can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes (-),
    to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request. The server continuously
    processes each character, leading to excessive resource consumption and rendering
    the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not require any
    user interaction, impacting all users of the service.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to version 1.56.2 or later.
    2. Implement robust input validation for multipart boundaries in HTTP requests.
    3. Monitor server resource utilization for unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack.
