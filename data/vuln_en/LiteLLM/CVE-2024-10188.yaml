  summary: LiteLLM is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to improper input parsing.
  details: |
    A vulnerability in BerriAI/litellm, as of commit 26c03c9, allows unauthenticated users to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by exploiting the use of ast.literal_eval to parse user input. This function is not safe and is prone to DoS attacks, which can crash the litellm Python server.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to version 1.53.1.dev1 or later.
    2. Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the use of unsafe functions like `ast.literal_eval` with untrusted user input.
    3. Review and update dependencies to ensure all components are secure.
