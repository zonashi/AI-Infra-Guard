  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2025-0628
  summary: LiteLLM has an improper authorization vulnerability allowing privilege escalation.
  details: |
    An improper authorization vulnerability exists in the main-latest version of BerriAI/litellm.
    A user with the 'internal_user_viewer' role receives an overly privileged API key,
    which can be used to access all admin functionality, including '/users/list' and '/users/get_users' endpoints.
    This allows for privilege escalation, enabling any account to become a PROXY ADMIN.

  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to version 1.61.15 or later.
    2. Review and restrict API key permissions for 'internal_user_viewer' roles.
    3. Implement granular access control to prevent unauthorized access to admin functionalities.
