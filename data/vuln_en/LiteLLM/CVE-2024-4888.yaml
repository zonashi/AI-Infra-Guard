info:
  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-4888
  summary: Arbitrary file deletion in LiteLLM due to improper input validation.
  details: |
    BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to improper input validation on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that includes a file path to the server, which then deletes the specified file without proper authorization or validation. This vulnerability is present in the code where `os.remove(file.filename)` is used to delete a file, allowing any user to delete critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, or configuration files.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to version 1.35.36 or later.
    2. Implement strict input validation for file paths on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint.
    3. Ensure proper authorization checks are in place before deleting files.
