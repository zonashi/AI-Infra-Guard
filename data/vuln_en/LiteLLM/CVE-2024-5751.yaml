info:
  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-5751
  summary: LiteLLM is vulnerable to remote code execution due to unsafe use of `eval`.
  details: |
    BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve remote code execution. 
    The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables 
    from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload 
    to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` 
    function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to version 1.40.16 or later.
    2. Ensure that the server does not use Google KMS and a database to store models if not absolutely necessary, 
       as this is a prerequisite for exploitation.
    3. Review and sanitize all inputs to the `/config/update` endpoint to prevent malicious payload injection.
rule: version > "0" && version < "1.40.16"
