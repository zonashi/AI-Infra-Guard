info:
  name: LiteLLM
  cve: CVE-2024-6825
  summary: LiteLLM is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper handling of 'post_call_rules' configuration.
  details: |
    BerriAI/litellm version 1.40.12 contains a vulnerability that allows remote code execution. 
    The issue exists in the handling of the 'post_call_rules' configuration, where a callback function can be added. 
    The provided value is split at the final '.' mark, with the last part considered the function name and the remaining part appended with the '.py' extension and imported. 
    This allows an attacker to set a system method, such as 'os.system', as a callback, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands when a chat response is processed.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade LiteLLM to a version beyond 1.40.12 that addresses this vulnerability.
    2. Review and sanitize all inputs used in 'post_call_rules' configuration to prevent arbitrary code execution.
    3. Implement strict validation for callback function names and modules to ensure only trusted functions are executed.
rule: version > "1.40.3.dev2" && version <= "1.40.12"
