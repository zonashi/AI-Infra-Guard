  cve: CVE-2025-57760
  summary: Langflow is vulnerable to privilege escalation via CLI superuser creation after an authenticated user gains RCE.
  details: |
    A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Langflow containers. An authenticated user with Remote Code Execution (RCE) access can invoke the internal CLI command `langflow superuser` to create a new administrative user. This grants full superuser access, even if the user initially registered through the UI as a regular (non-admin) account. This bypasses frontend role enforcement and backend user integrity, leading to a full compromise of the Langflow application.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Langflow to a version greater than 1.5.0.
    2. Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized execution of internal CLI commands.
    3. Ensure that the `langflow superuser` command checks for existing superusers and prevents the creation of new ones without proper authorization.
    4. Review and harden the `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint to prevent RCE vulnerabilities.
rule: version > "0" && version <= "1.5.0"
