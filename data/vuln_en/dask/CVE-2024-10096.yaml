info:
  name: dask
  cve: CVE-2024-10096
  summary: Dask is vulnerable to command injection due to pickle serialization.
  details: |
    Dask versions <=2024.8.2 contain a vulnerability in the Dask Distributed Server where the use of pickle serialization allows attackers to craft malicious objects. These objects can be serialized on the client side and sent to the server for deserialization, leading to remote command execution and potentially granting full control over the Dask server.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. This advisory has been withdrawn because it describes intended functionality.
    2. Review Dask's security limitations regarding pickle serialization.
    3. Implement secure serialization practices and restrict untrusted input.
rule: version > "0" && version <= "2024.8.2"
