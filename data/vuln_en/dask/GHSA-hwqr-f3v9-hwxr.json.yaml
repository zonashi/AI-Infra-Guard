info:
  name: dask
  cve: CVE-2021-42343
  summary: Workers for local Dask clusters mistakenly listened on public interfaces.
  details: |
    Versions of `distributed` earlier than `2021.10.0` had a potential security vulnerability relating to single-machine Dask clusters.
    Clusters started with `dask.distributed.LocalCluster` or `dask.distributed.Client()` would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces rather than only on `localhost`. A Dask cluster created using this method AND running on a machine that has these ports exposed could be used by a sophisticated attacker to enable remote code execution.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade `distributed` to version `2021.10.0` or later.
    2. Ensure standard firewalls are in place to restrict access to Dask worker ports.
    3. If using `LocalCluster`, verify that workers are bound to `localhost` only.
rule: version > "0" && version < "2021.10.0"
