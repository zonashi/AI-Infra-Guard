  name: ray
  cve: CVE-2025-62593
  summary: Ray is vulnerable to Critical RCE via Safari & Firefox Browsers through DNS Rebinding Attack.
  details: |
    Developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari. This is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the `User-Agent` header starting with the string "Mozilla" as a defense mechanism, which is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the `User-Agent` header to be modified. Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement.
