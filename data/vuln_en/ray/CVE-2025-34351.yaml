  name: ray
  cve: CVE-2025-34351
  summary: Ray's new token authentication is disabled by default, leading to unauthorized access and arbitrary code execution.
  details: |
    Anyscale Ray 2.52.0 contains an insecure default configuration where token-based authentication for Ray management interfaces (including the dashboard and Jobs API) is disabled unless explicitly enabled by setting `RAY_AUTH_MODE=token`. In this default unauthenticated state, a remote attacker with network access to these interfaces can submit jobs and execute arbitrary code on the Ray cluster.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N
  severity: CRITICAL
  security_advise: |
    1. Enable token authentication by setting `RAY_AUTH_MODE=token` to protect your cluster from unauthorized access.
    2. Upgrade to a future Ray release where token authentication is enabled by default.
