  name: dify
  cve: CVE-2025-11750
  summary: Dify-web user enumeration vulnerability via differing error messages.
  details: |
    In langgenius/dify-web version 1.6.0, the authentication mechanism reveals the existence of user accounts by returning different error messages for non-existent and existing accounts. Specifically, when a login or registration attempt is made with a non-existent username or email, the system responds with a message such as "account not found." Conversely, when the username or email exists but the password is incorrect, a different error message is returned. This discrepancy allows an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts by analyzing the error responses, potentially facilitating targeted social engineering, brute force, or credential stuffing attacks.
  cvss: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Implement consistent error messages for both existing and non-existing accounts during login or registration attempts.
    2. Avoid revealing specific details about why an authentication attempt failed.
    3. Consider rate-limiting login attempts to mitigate brute-force and enumeration attacks.
