  cve: CVE-2025-64439
  summary: LangGraph Checkpoint affected by RCE in "json" mode of JsonPlusSerializer.
  details: |
    Prior to `langgraph-checkpoint` version `3.0`, LangGraph’s `JsonPlusSerializer` (used as the default serialization protocol for all checkpointing) contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability when deserializing payloads saved in the `"json"` serialization mode. If an attacker can cause your application to persist a payload serialized in this mode, they may be able to also send malicious content that executes arbitrary Python code during deserialization.
  cvss: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade immediately to `langgraph-checkpoint==3.0.0`.
    2. If deploying in `langgraph-api`, update to version `0.5` or later.
rule: version < "3.0.0"
