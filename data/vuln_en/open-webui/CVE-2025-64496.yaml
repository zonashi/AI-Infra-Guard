  cve: CVE-2025-64496
  summary: Open WebUI is vulnerable to code injection via Server-Sent Events (SSE) from external model servers when Direct Connections are enabled.
  details: |
    Open WebUI versions 0.6.33 and below contain a code injection vulnerability in the Direct Connections feature. Malicious external model servers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers through Server-Sent Event (SSE) `execute` events. This can lead to authentication token theft, complete account takeover, and when chained with the Functions API, enables remote code execution on the backend server. The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by default) and add the attacker's malicious model URL, which can be achieved through social engineering. The vulnerability stems from the frontend JavaScript code processing SSE events without proper validation, specifically handling an `execute` event type that triggers arbitrary JavaScript execution using `new Function(event.data.code)`.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade Open WebUI to version 0.6.35 or later.
    2. Avoid enabling "Direct Connections" from untrusted sources.
    3. Exercise caution when adding external model URLs, especially those obtained through social engineering.
    4. Implement strict Content Security Policies (CSP) to mitigate arbitrary JavaScript execution.
rule: version > "0" && version < "0.6.35"
