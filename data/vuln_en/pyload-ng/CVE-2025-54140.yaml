info:
  name: pyload-ng
  cve: CVE-2025-54140
  summary: pyLoad has a Path Traversal Vulnerability in the json/upload Endpoint that allows Arbitrary File Write.
  details: |
    An authenticated path traversal vulnerability exists in the `/json/upload` endpoint of `pyLoad`.
    By manipulating the filename of an uploaded file, an attacker can traverse out of the intended upload directory,
    allowing them to write arbitrary files to any location on the system accessible to the pyLoad process.
    This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Local Privilege Escalation, system-wide compromise, and persistence/backdoors.
    The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization or validation on `file.filename` in `src/pyload/webui/app/blueprints/json_blueprint.py`,
    allowing traversal via `../../` sequences.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to pyload-ng version 0.5.0b3.dev90 or later.
    2. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for filenames in the `/json/upload` endpoint to prevent path traversal sequences.
    3. Ensure that the directory where uploaded files are saved is properly secured and has minimal write permissions.
rule: version < "0.5.0b3.dev90"
