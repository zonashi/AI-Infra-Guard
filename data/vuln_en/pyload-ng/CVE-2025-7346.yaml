info:
  name: pyload-ng
  cve: CVE-2025-7346
  summary: pyLoad is vulnerable to attacks that bypass localhost restrictions, enabling the creation of arbitrary packages.
  details: |
    Any unauthenticated attacker can bypass the localhost restrictions posed by the application and utilize this to create arbitrary packages. This is done by changing the `Host` header to the value of `127.0.0.1:9666`. This allows an unauthenticated user to perform actions that should only be available to authenticated users.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to a patched version of pyLoad-ng.
    2. Implement more robust host header validation to prevent bypasses.
    3. Ensure that sensitive actions are only accessible to authenticated users, regardless of the `Host` header.
