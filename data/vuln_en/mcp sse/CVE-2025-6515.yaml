info:
  name: mcp sse
  cve: CVE-2025-6515
  summary: Insecure session ID generation in oatpp-mcp's MCP SSE endpoint.
  details: |
    The MCP SSE endpoint in oatpp-mcp returns an instance pointer as the session ID.
    This session ID is neither unique nor cryptographically secure, allowing network
    attackers with access to the oatpp-mcp server to guess future session IDs.
    This vulnerability can lead to the hijacking of legitimate client MCP sessions,
    enabling attackers to return malicious responses from the oatpp-mcp server.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Implement a robust session ID generation mechanism that ensures uniqueness and cryptographic security.
    2. Avoid using instance pointers or other predictable values as session identifiers.
    3. Consider using industry-standard session management practices, such as those recommended by OWASP.
