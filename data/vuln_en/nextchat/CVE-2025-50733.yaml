  name: nextchat
  cve: CVE-2025-50733
  summary: NextChat is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of AI-generated HTML content.
  details: |
    NextChat contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the HTMLPreview component of artifacts.tsx.
    Attackers can exploit this by crafting prompts that cause the AI to generate malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
    When a user views the HTML preview, the injected JavaScript executes in their browser context, potentially leading to API key exfiltration, unauthorized actions, and session hijacking.
    The vulnerability arises because user-influenced HTML from AI responses is rendered in an iframe with 'allow-scripts' sandbox permission without proper sanitization.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  severity: MEDIUM
  security_advise: |
    1. Implement robust HTML sanitization for all AI-generated content before rendering it in the HTMLPreview component.
    2. Consider stricter sandbox policies for iframes rendering untrusted content, disallowing script execution if not absolutely necessary.
    3. Educate users about the risks of interacting with untrusted or suspicious AI-generated content.
