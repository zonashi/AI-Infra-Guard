  cve: CVE-2025-48956
  summary: vllm API endpoints are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks due to large HTTP headers.
  details: |
    A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can be triggered by sending a single HTTP GET request with an extremely large header to an HTTP endpoint. This results in server memory exhaustion, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. The attack does not require authentication, making it exploitable by any remote user.
    The vulnerability leverages the abuse of HTTP headers. By setting a header such as `X-Forwarded-For` to a very large value like `("A" * 5_800_000_000)`, the server's HTTP parser or application logic may attempt to load the entire request into memory, overwhelming system resources.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade to a version of vLLM that includes appropriate HTTP limits by default (e.g., vllm>=0.10.1.1).
    2. Alternatively, use a proxy in front of vLLM which provides protection against this issue.
rule: version > "0.1.0" && version < "0.10.1.1"
