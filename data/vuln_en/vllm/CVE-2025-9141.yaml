  name: vllm
  cve: CVE-2025-9141
  summary: vLLM has remote code execution vulnerability in the tool call parser for Qwen3-Coder.
  details: |
    An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server if they are able to get the model to pass the code as an argument to a tool call.
    vLLM's Qwen3 Coder tool parser contains a code execution path that uses Python's `eval()` function to parse tool call parameters when the parameter type is not explicitly defined or recognized, and tool calling is enabled with the qwen3_coder parser specified.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade vLLM to version 0.10.1.1 or later.
    2. Avoid enabling tool calling with the `qwen3_coder` parser if possible, especially in untrusted environments.
rule: version >= "0.10.0" && version < "0.10.1.1"
