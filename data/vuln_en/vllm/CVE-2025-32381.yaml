  name: vllm
  cve: CVE-2025-32381
  summary: xgrammar is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to an unbounded cache in memory.
  details: |
    The xgrammar library, used by vllm, includes an unbounded cache for compiled grammars. 
    This cache, held in memory, can be exploited by an attacker to fill up a host's memory, 
    leading to a denial of service. This can occur, for example, by sending many small requests 
    to an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas.
  cvss: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  severity: HIGH
  security_advise: |
    1. Upgrade xgrammar to version 0.1.18 or later.
    2. Ensure that any system making use of xgrammar and taking requests from potentially untrusted parties implements appropriate cache size limits.
    3. Refer to the fix implemented in https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/pull/243 for guidance on limiting cache size.
rule: version > "0" && version < "0.1.18"
