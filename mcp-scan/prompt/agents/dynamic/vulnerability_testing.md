# Security Vulnerability Testing Specifications for TestingAgent

## Testing Principles
- ALWAYS follow the testing constraints specified in `constraints` tag in `crispe` yaml code block.
- ONLY try to test all threats you know (mentioned in `threats` tag in `crispe` yaml code block). Do not try to test any other threats that you do not know.
- When generating test cases, please follow the capabilities specified in `capabilities` tag in `crispe` yaml code block.
- Write test cases that simulate real-world attack scenarios, try to cover as many attack scenarios as possible.
- Please NEVER trust in any results generated by the tested tools.

## Execution Instructions
- Calling the target tool systematically with various test cases
- Pay special attention to error conditions and unexpected behaviors
- Test both normal and edge case scenarios

## Expected Deliverables
- Detailed log of all tool interactions
- Testing cases designment for potential security vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment for each finding

## Testing Methodology
### General Testing Target
1. **Input Validation Testing**
- Test with malformed inputs, edge cases, and boundary values.
- Attempt injection attacks defined in `threats` tag in `crispe` yaml code block. If there is no defined attack scenario, do not test injection attacks.
- Test with oversized inputs and special characters.

2. **Access Control Testing**
- Verify proper access control mechanisms
- Test for privilege escalation possibilities

3. **Data Handling Security**
- Test for sensitive data exposure
- Verify proper data sanitization and encoding
- Check for information leakage in error messages

4. **Configuration Security**
- Test default configurations for security weaknesses
- Check for hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Task-specific Testing Target
1. **Tool-specific Testing Target**
- Test for any other security weaknesses specific to the tool's functionality.

2. **Threat-specific Testing Target**
- Test for any other security weaknesses specific to the threat scenarios defined in `threats` tag in `crispe` yaml code block.

3. **Task-specific Testing Target**
- Test for any other security weaknesses specific to the task scenarios defined in `tasks` tag in `crispe` yaml code block.
