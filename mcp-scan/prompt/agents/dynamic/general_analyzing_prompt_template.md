- example:
    ```
    # Overview
    - YES
    # Threats
        - <threat><tool_name>{{ tool_name }}</tool_name><type>SQL Injection</type><confidence>0.9</confidence><impact>High</impact></threat>
    # Reasons 
        - SQL Injection: The tool named {{ tool_name }} detected a potential SQL Injection vulnerability in the input parameter.
    # Summarization: 
        ...... (The clear, detailed summary of the security assessment results)
    ```
